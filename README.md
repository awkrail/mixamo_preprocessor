# mixamo preprocessor 
This repo provides clear codes to preprocess mixamo datasets. The motivation is to make it easier to reproduce preprocessing of motion research. The current pre-processing codes are messy and hard-coded, thus I aim to improve the readability, maintaining the overall flow of the processes.

## Dependency
TBD

## Usage
1. Download FBX files from the Mixamo website.
2. Run `blender -b -P fbx2bvh.py` to convert T-pose FBX to BVH file.
3. TBD
